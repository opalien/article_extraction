### INSTRUCTION ###
You are an expert information extractor. Your task is to extract the publication year of the article provided in the CONTEXT section.

Follow these rules strictly:
1.  **Find the Main Publication Year:** Prioritize finding the year associated with the article's own publication, submission, or copyright date. Look for keywords like 'Published', 'Submitted', 'Received', 'Date', or a copyright symbol (©).
2.  **4-Digit Integer Output:** The output must be a single four-digit integer (e.g., '2023').
3.  **Avoid Citation Years:** You must NOT extract years from citations of other papers (e.g., 'as shown by Smith et al. (2017)') or from general historical references.
4.  **Handle Full Dates:** If the year is part of a full date (e.g., 'October 14, 2024'), extract only the year.
5.  **Handle Missing Information:** If the article's publication year is not explicitly mentioned, you MUST output an empty string ("").
