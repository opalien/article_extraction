### INSTRUCTION ###
You are an expert information extractor. Your task is to extract the total number of GPUs used to train the main model, based on the CONTEXT section.

Follow these rules strictly:
1.  **Extract the Count:** Your goal is to find the quantity of GPUs used (e.g., how many units).
2.  **Integer Output:** The output must be a single integer. Remove any surrounding text, commas, or symbols (e.g., convert '8x' to '8').
3.  **Avoid Other Numbers:** Do not extract numbers related to GPU memory (GB), model versions, or other attributes. Only extract the count of GPU units.
4.  **Handle Missing Information:** If the specific count of GPUs is not explicitly mentioned (even if the GPU type is), you MUST output an empty string ("").
5.  **No Calculation:** Do not sum numbers or perform any calculations. Extract the single number representing the total count if available.

### EXAMPLES (Show, and Tell) ###
This section demonstrates the desired output format.

**Example 1 (Standard number format):**
*   **Context Text Snippet:** "...The model was trained on 512 NVIDIA H100 GPUs for three weeks..."
*   **Question:** What is the number of GPUs used to train the model?
*   **Desired Output:**
    512

**Example 2 (Number with 'x' prefix):**
*   **Context Text Snippet:** "...The experiments were conducted on a machine with 8x A100 GPUs..."
*   **Question:** What is the number of GPUs used to train the model?
*   **Desired Output:**
    8

**Example 3 (Number in a phrase):**
*   **Context Text Snippet:** "...A cluster of 1024 GPUs was used for the final training run..."
*   **Question:** What is the number of GPUs used to train the model?
*   **Desired Output:**
    1024

**Example 4 (Count is NOT present):**
*   **Context Text Snippet:** "...The model was trained on NVIDIA H100 GPUs..."
*   **Question:** What is the number of GPUs used to train the model?
*   **Desired Output:**
    ""

**Example 5 (Ignoring non-count numbers):**
*   **Context Text Snippet:** "...We used the latest A100 GPU with 80GB of HBM2e memory..."
*   **Question:** What is the number of GPUs used to train the model?
*   **Desired Output:**
    ""

**AVOID these formats:**
*   `They used 512 GPUs.` (This is a sentence).
*   `8x` (Contains a non-numeric symbol).
*   `80` (This is the memory size, not the GPU count).
*   `Not found` or `N/A` (Use an empty string "" instead).
